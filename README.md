# jupyprint

[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/jupyprint)](https://pepy.tech/project/jupyprint)

A simple python package to print markdown and LaTeX equations from code cells in
Jupyter notebooks.

`jupyprint` let's you print your variables as markdown/LaTeX.

You can print LaTeX strings involving 'live' variables (e.g. the variables you
are using in your jupyter code cells). 

You can print numpy arrays as LaTeX matrices and you can print nice-looking pandas
dataframes.

To install use: `pip install jupyprint`

See https://github.com/pxr687/jupyprint/blob/main/jupyprint_demo.ipynb for a 
demo. Here are some screenshots from the demo (there are no markdown cells in 
the demo notebook, all the markdown/LaTeX is printed from the code cells):
