# jupyprint

A simple python package to print markdown and LaTeX equations in Jupyter notebooks.

jupyprint let's you print your variables as markdown/LaTex.

You can print LaTeX strings (including 'live' variables).
You can print numpy arrays as LaTeX matrices.
You can print nice-looking pandas dataframes.

See `jupyprint_demo.ipynb` for a demo. Here are some screenshots from the demo
(there are no markdown cells in the notebook, all the markdown/LaTeX is printed
from the code cells):
