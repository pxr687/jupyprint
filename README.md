# jupyprint

A simple python package to print markdown and LaTeX equations from code cells in
Jupyter notebooks.

`jupyprint` let's you print your variables as markdown/LaTex.

You can print LaTeX strings involving 'live' variables (e.g. the variables you
are using in your jupyter code cells). 

You can print numpy arrays as LaTeX matrices and you can print nice-looking pandas
dataframes.

See `jupyprint_demo.ipynb` for a demo. Here are some screenshots from the demo
(there are no markdown cells in the notebook, all the markdown/LaTeX is printed
from the code cells):
