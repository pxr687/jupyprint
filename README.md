# jupyprint

A simple python package to print markdown and LaTeX equations in Jupyter notebooks.

jupyprint can print LaTeX strings (including 'live' variables), it will show
numpy arrays as LaTeX matrices, and will also render nice-looking pandas
dataframes.

See `jupyprint_demo.ipynb` for a demo. Here are some screenshots from the demo
(there are no markdown cells in the notebook, all the markdown/LaTeX is printed
from the code cells):
