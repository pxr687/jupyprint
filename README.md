# jupyprint

A simple python package to print markdown and LaTeX equations in Jupyter notebooks.

jupyprint can print LaTeX equations (including 'live' variables), it will show
numpy arrays as LaTeX matrices, and will also render nice-looking pandas
dataframes.

See `jupyprint_demo.ipynb` for a demo.
